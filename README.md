# K-means-Algorithm-for-Clustering

Implemented the k-means clustering algorithm from scratch in Python, using a dataset. The algorithm was designed to accept any user-given value for k (number of clusters), with a default value of 2.

Created a Python executable file with a function KMeans(<datasetFile>, K), where <datasetFile> is the path to the data file and K is the number of clusters.

Visualized the clustering process by outputting images at three stages of the algorithm: the initial assignment of clusters, a mid-point during the clustering process, and the final clustered dataset.
